#                                      ja2-113-AR-2020-update

 <p>Attempt to update the Mod ArulcoRevisited (AR) to use with recent (starting 2020) versions of JA2-1.13</p>

# WORK IN PROGRESS, consider yourself warned. There will be files soon as well :-)

 <h4>Preample </h4>
 
 <p>JA2v1.13 itself is a modification (mod) for the game Jagged Alliance 2. It tweaks and expands the vanilla game with goodies
  like improved AI, lots of new features and new items and weapons, while it leaves the original campaign and maps untouched.</p> 
  <p>But it also comes with externalisation of source-files and in the result acts as a plattform for other mods based on this.</p>
  
  <p>One of those mods is Arulco Revisited, which basicly comes with new maps and thought to encourage the player to a live out the
land playstyle.</p>

<h4>The Situation </h4>

<p>While JA2v.1.13 still is under development up until now and an update is available every one to three months, AR has last seen 
an update in 2014. It still can be perfectly played with older versions of v1.13, even with other mods on top (item-mods like SDO) 
and is compatible to another branch of v.1.13 development which adds smarter AI and other amazing goodies (Experimental Project/im
proved AI), but over the years the gap in compabilty to recent v1.13 versions has grown.</p>

<h4>The Problem </h4>

<p>This gap in compability origins from the constantly development of externalized files. A lot more have been externalized since, 
some of the old ones became obsolete, many entries in existing ones have been changed and/or added for newer features, etc.</p>
<p>And since variety is the spice of live, it would be sad if AR couldn't be used with those new features of v1.13. In my opinion,
many features make the game more challenging and entertaining and most of all, they probably will fit the live-out-the-land style 
just perfect.</p>

<h4>The Attempt </h4>

<p>No coding is required for this. All files of interest are externalized ones. That's the pro, the con is, that it is a lot of tedious work comparing old and new files to find out what changes needs to be done and what other files must be added due to new features dependencies.</p>
 <p>In the beginning, I thought this could be done in two or three weeks, but here we are more then halv a year later. Basicly that's 'cause I have never done anything like that and had to learn a lot about relations, dependencies and handling of the files (xml and lua) and a lot of intense playtesting to get a deeper understanding about how features work.</p> 
 <p>Map related work also increased my learning curve, since I had to wrap my mind arround sti and jsd files, both rather odd ones I dare to say. The list is rather long, each time I solved a problem I stumbled accross the next one, or something completely unrelated peaked my interest while rummaging the forum or playing other mods for references and hints how things are done. But as you just also realized, I tend to rumble on and on, so better stop now.</p>
 <p>Beside some early frustrations, this has turned into quite an interest for me and sure is fun on it's own.</p>
  
 <h4>The Plan </h4> 
  
  <p>Providing one, "plain" AR-update version that just deals with the nescessary changes. This has come pretty far and should be up in early 2020. Reason for this is mainly for compabilty reasons with other mods </p>
  
  <p>Later on present some "expanded" version of this Update, including new maps, new basements, new hostiles and bunch of other things I plan to implement. Recently I tried to learn more about item-mods and random placements as well, but... This will take some time, e.g. I also have used graphics from other mods and still have to ask permisssions. A lot of things are allready done, a lot still needs to be done, but this version will be on hold until the "plain" one is up, otherwise I fear I'll never get finished. I originally planned to upload them both the same time, but on the other hand it might be good to get some feedback on the basics before marching on. </p>
  
<h4>The Surplus </h4>  

<p>Since I had to learn a lot while fumble with this mod, I took a pile of notes on how things might be done. I like to add this knowledge into the mod. So where ever possible I added descriptions on what I've done directly into the xml and lua files. Stuff like description of tags, what are they used for and where are relations and dependencies or How-to-do Molle-Items for e.g. </p>
 <p>I hope that this might can help others that start with zero knowledge just like me and encourage them to do their own modding. Of course it would be very nice to get feedback on this as well, tell me if you find mistakes or can add things where I couldn't. </p> 
 
 <p>Main reason I put this up on github was having the oportunity to make an SVN to keep the versions up to date to changes in future v1.13 that might effect the files I dealt with. </p>
  
 <h4>The Credits </h4> 
 
  <p>The original Arulco Revisited has been created by Beka and JAsmine, non of my work would be possible without them. All credits for the mod goes to them, I just did an update.</p>
  
  <p>The Ar-update from 2014 was made by Strohmann and CVB made an patch for this to enable some, in the time, newer features. That's the version I started working with and it was very helpful to see what they have done. My interest for modding was not at last peaked by their work.</p>
  
  <p>All the incredible mod-authors whose mods helped me to never loose interset in JA2 over all this years. Thanks for the entertainment and the hard work.</p>
  
  <p>And of course all the authors, coders, tool-developers and community members at the amazing <a href="http://thepit.ja-galaxy-forum.com/">Bear Pit's Forum</a> Thanks for still working on 1.13 and all the patience you had while sharing knowledge with me and answer annoying questions. This is also the place where you can download latest v1.13 and tons of other astonishing mods. Give them a try, it's worth it.</p>
